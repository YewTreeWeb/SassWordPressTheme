# SassWordPressTheme
This is a WordPress Theme created from scratch by me using Bootstrap 3. A lot of the jQuery functionality of the theme is also created by me such as the animations on scroll, smooth scrolling, sliders etc. This theme is very much a work in progress and in development.

I plan to develop the theme so that a user will be able to customise the look without any coding knowledge but also easily edit the theme if they have. My future plans for the theme are to finish the admin area allowing the user to be able to turn on off parallax scrolling, positioning logos, post formats etc. As well as creating my own contact form. Plus much more.

Once finished I tend to create multiple versions, to give users the opportunity to choose which style they prefer. The versions will be:
- Less (exactly the same theme just instead of sass)
- Bootstrap 4
- Foundation 6
- Bourbon, Neat, Bitters and Refills

In the final stages of my theme once I have finished the multiple version I would then like to adapt it to other platforms such as:
- Shopify
- Jekyll (2 versions with and without Jade)
- Magento

As an optional stage I have even thought of eventually turning the theme into a Yeoman package.
